      <p>I am a doctoral student at <a href="https://rossier.usc.edu/programs/doctoral-degree-programs/directory">USC Rossier</a> researching K-12 Education Policy. My primary research
        area is school finance. Other areas in which I have worked include school choice and LGBT education policy. I aim to leverage the methodological tools (e.g. causal inference approaches, multilevel modeling)
        which are more common in the study of finance to my work in other areas. My goals are to produce policy-relevant, timely work that has the potential to improve student outcomes and experiences. </p>
