Grades in phd programs should be pass fail, or un/satisfactory. We can have a 
low pass too. I am (hopefully) almost done getting grades. Certainly there 
are many other ways I will be evaluated through to the end of my program, 
but a letter with a + or - won't be one of them. Whats a better time to think
about what they mean than post-mortem.

  In undergrad, grades had meaning at minimum as signals for internships, grad schools, and to 
  keep my scholarship (thanks for that!). The close tie between money and grades made it hard for 
  grades to have their own meaning. Now people ask for a CV 
  not a GPA. Their value as signals is gone. I still must maintain a
  minimum, but I don't worry about that. I did worry about 
getting a passing grade for a moment last semester.

  I was worried about making the grade because the grade was 
  sending students a signal, sort of. The class was curved, and immediately 
  reminded me of the last class I took that was that much of a learning curve. 
  Multivariable calc the first semester of my freshman year at some time 
  the felt much earlier than it was. I remember 15% of the class leaving one exam in tears.

  People looked dazed and confused after the exam but no tears in the grad class.
